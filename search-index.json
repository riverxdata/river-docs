The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism in CPython that ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core processors.

Although multiple threads can be created, they do not achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks due to the GIL. However, Python threads can still improve performance for I/O-bound tasks like downloading or uploading files because the CPU spends most of its time waiting for external resources. The Python interpreter quickly switches between threads, saving and restoring their states, making it appear as if multiple threads are running simultaneously. In reality, the CPU rapidly cycles through threads, ensuring that tasks that do not require significant computation feel like they are running in parallel.","s":"What is GIL and how thread in python work ?","u":"/river-docs/blog/python-thread","h":"#what-is-gil-and-how-thread-in-python-work-","p":32},{"i":42,"t":"A simple function in python, create 2 files as below single_worker.py.

Even with more threads, they still need to share resources like internet bandwidth, and switching between threads adds overhead. As a result, the execution time was 1.23s instead of 1s, showing that too many threads can slow things down. In general, for CPU-bound tasks, the number of threads should match the number of CPUs. However, for I/O-bound tasks like network requests, you can experiment with more threads to maximize efficiency.

While it is typically deployed across multi-node clusters, setting up SLURM on a single node can be highly beneficial for testing, development, or running lightweight workloads. This guide will help you understand the fundamental concepts of how a scheduler operates and provide a step-by-step walkthrough to configure SLURM with full functionality on a single-node setup. How to Set Up a Fully Functional SLURM Cluster on a Single Node (with Proper Resource Constraints) SLURM is a powerful job scheduler widely used in HPC environments, but configuring it properly—especially on a single-node cluster—can be tricky. Many tutorials cover the basics, like installing SLURM and running jobs, but they often overlook a critical aspect: cgroups (control groups). Without proper cgroup configuration, SLURM may fail to enforce CPU and memory constraints, allowing jobs to consume more resources than allocated. This can lead to performance degradation, system crashes, or unexpected behavior. In this guide, I’ll walk you through setting up a fully functional SLURM cluster on a single node, ensuring that CPU and memory limits are properly enforced using cgroups. Whether you're setting up a test environment or a lightweight HPC system, this tutorial will help you avoid common pitfalls and ensure that SLURM effectively manages resources as expected. Let’s dive in info This architecture is designed for a single node running Ubuntu 20.04. It supports all standard Slurm features. The setup is manual to help you understand how Slurm works.
