A Viewer is a user role with read-only permissions, allowing access to project data without modification capabilities. This role is ideal for stakeholders who need to review and validate results without altering the underlying storage.

Projects with `public` status enable users to execute tools dynamically without requiring explicit access permissions. It helps to share the results or harmonized data with community.

To obtain Viewer access, sign in to the RIVER platform using Google OAuth2 and submit an access request for your desired project. The project Administrator will review and grant access based on your registered Gmail address. Upon approval, you will be able to access the project with Viewer privileges.
