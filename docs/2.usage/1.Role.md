## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

River implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control system to ensure secure and organized workspace management. Users are assigned specific roles that determine their level of access and the operations they can perform within the platform.

### Permission Matrix

The following table outlines the capabilities associated with each role, based on CRUD operations:

- **Create (C)**: Ability to create new resources
- **Read (R)**: Ability to view and access resources
- **Update (U)**: Ability to modify existing resources
- **Delete (D)**: Ability to remove resources


### Role Assignment

Workspace administrators can assign and modify user roles through the workspace settings interface. Role changes take effect immediately upon assignment.

### Viewer

Viewers have read-only access to the workspace and can view content without making any changes.
