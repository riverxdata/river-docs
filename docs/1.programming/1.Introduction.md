## Setting Up Your Development Environment  

Before diving into coding, it's essential to set up the right tools on your computer. A proper development environment streamlines your workflow and enhances productivity.  

## Essential Tools to Install  

🔹 **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**  
   A good IDE provides a space for writing, debugging, and managing your code efficiently.  

🔹 **Source Control**  
   Version control systems help teams collaborate by syncing, reviewing, and testing scripts seamlessly.
