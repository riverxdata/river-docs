There are 3 components related to credentials: version control (GitHub), S3 storage (AWS), and SSH (HPC). These credentials are securely stored secrets that enable interaction with remote resources from the RIVER platform.

**SSH Credentials** store connection details for HPC systems including host, port, username, encrypted private key, optional passphrase, home directory, and server type (e.g., SLURM).

**GitHub Credentials** contain username and personal access token for repository access.

**AWS Credentials** include access key, encrypted secret key, optional endpoint URL, assume role ARN, and region configuration for S3 storage operations.

RIVER acts as the orchestrator, securely managing these credentials using Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key (AES-256) to enable seamless integration across services without manual intervention.
