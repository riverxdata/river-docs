Nf-core is the largest community-driven platform for curated bioinformatics workflow development. The RIVER platform is designed with nf-core as its primary focus, executing Nextflow pipelines directly on HPC infrastructure with native S3 integration, without requiring middleware layers. The platform is engineered to support all existing nf-core pipelines.

Running Nextflow pipelines with nf-core can present unique challenges and considerations. Our team provides detailed blog posts demonstrating how to execute these pipelines with real datasets and optimize them as needed.

**Tested Pipelines:**

1. **[sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek)**: Variant calling pipeline for germline and somatic variants from whole genome, exome, or targeted sequencing data. Supports tumor/normal analyses.
2. **[rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq)**: RNA-seq processing pipeline that includes quality control, alignment or pseudo-alignment, quantification, and generation of gene expression matrices.
3. **[ampliseq](https://github.com/nf-core/ampliseq)**: Amplicon sequencing pipeline for microbial community profiling, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
4. **[quantms](https://nf-co.re/quantms)**: Quantitative proteomics pipeline for label-free and isobaric labeling analyses using both DDA and DIA data.
5. **[taxprofiler](https://nf-co.re/taxprofiler)**: Taxonomic profiling pipeline for shotgun metagenomics, supporting multiple tools and producing standardized outputs.
6. **[methylseq](https://nf-co.re/methylseq)**: DNA methylation analysis pipeline using bisulfite-treated sequencing data. Supports multiple aligners and provides comprehensive QC.
7. **[circrna](https://nf-co.re/circrna)**: Pipeline for detecting and quantifying circular RNAs (circRNAs) from RNA-seq data, including miRNA target prediction.
8. **[mag](https://nf-co.re/mag)**: Metagenomic pipeline for assembling, binning, and annotating metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from short or long reads.
9. **[atacseq](https://nf-co.re/atacseq)**: ATAC-seq pipeline to identify open chromatin regions, perform peak calling, and assess data quality with various QC metrics.
10. **[rnafusion](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion)**: Fusion detection pipeline using RNA-seq data, combining results from multiple fusion detection tools into reports and visualizations.
