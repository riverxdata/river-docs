Pixi is a fast, modern package management tool built on the conda ecosystem. Whether you're on a personal laptop or an HPC cluster, Pixi makes environment setup simple and reproducible. Here’s a primer on using Pixi. For a full workflow, see: [**Setting up single-cell RNA-seq analysis with Pixi**](https://ngs101.com/setting-up-single-cell-rna-seq-analysis-environment-with-pixi-10x-faster-setup-zero-version-conflicts/) as collaboration between **RIVERXDATA** and **NGS101**

## Installing Pixi

### System Requirements

- **OS**: Any modern Unix (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Arch, MacOS, etc.)
- **Disk Space**: 50–100 MB for Pixi, plus space for packages/cache
- **Privileges**: No sudo/root needed—Pixi installs in user space

Ideal for shared environments without admin access.

### One-Line Installation

Run in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads Pixi, installs it to `~/.pixi/bin`, and updates your shell config. After install, restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Verify Installation

Check Pixi is working:

```bash
pixi --version
pixi --help
```

## HPC Configuration

### Custom Cache Location

To avoid home directory quotas, set a custom cache:

```bash
export PIXI_CACHE_DIR=/scratch/$USER/pixi-cache
```
Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for persistence.

### Proxy Settings

If your cluster uses a proxy, edit `$HOME/.pixi/config.toml`:

```toml
[proxy-config]
http = "http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
https = "http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
non-proxy-hosts = [".cn", "localhost", "[::1]"]
```
See [Pixi configuration docs](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/reference/pixi_configuration/) for details.

### Parallel Downloads

Speed up downloads on fast networks:

```toml
[concurrency]
downloads = 5
```

## Project Activation

Pixi helps you create reproducible environments with lock files.

### Initialize a Project

```bash
pixi init
pixi workspace channel add conda-forge bioconda
pixi workspace platform add osx-arm64 linux-64
```

Example `pixi.toml`:

```toml
[workspace]
channels = ["bioconda", "conda-forge"]
name = "<your project>"
platforms = ["linux-64", "osx-arm64"]
version = "0.1.0"

[tasks]

[dependencies]
```

### Add Tools

```bash
pixi add fastqc multiqc
```

Updates dependencies in `pixi.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
fastqc = ">=0.12.1,<0.13"
multiqc = ">=1.17,<2"
```

A `pixi.lock` file is created for reproducibility, specifying exact package versions and checksums.

### Run Tools

Run tools directly:

```bash
pixi run fastqc --help
```

Or activate the environment shell:

```bash
pixi shell
fastqc --help
```

## Recap

- Pixi is a user-space, conda-based package manager ideal for laptops and HPC clusters.
- Easy one-line installation, no admin rights needed.
- Supports custom cache and proxy settings for HPC environments.
- Enables reproducible project environments with lock files.
- Simple commands to add tools and run them in isolated environments.

Enjoy your Pixi-powered workflow!
